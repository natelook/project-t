# Tournaments.wtf

A tournament platform to make it easy for teams and players to compete no matter what the skill level.

## Roadmap

First step in the road map is to get a working version of the tournament creator. We want to be able to preview our software and use the early version of the site to gain attention as well as gain credibility. A new design rework will come shortly after. The look and feel of the site is only temporary of the original idea was to just make simple website that way it will be easy to reskin later down the road. Along with the redesign of the site more featured will be added. Auto match reporting (depending on availabilty of the specific games API), featured streams.
